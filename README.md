:green_circle: This project aims to classify bank clients into two groups, good payers and bad payers, in order to approve or deny credit.

:green_circle: This was an extra project in [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)'s Applied Data Science Bootcamp. The data was adapted by Alura from this [Kaggle problem](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction).

:green_circle: After analysing the data and arriving at a finished dataset, we began our machine learning part of the project. This can be found at this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/diascarolina/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/modulo6/aulas_desafios_modulo6.ipynb).

:green_circle: Finally, we took our finished machine learning model and used in a **Streamlit application** which can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/diascarolina/credit-scoring-streamlit/main/bytebank-credit-evaluation.py).

**For the future:**

- [ ] Improve the Machine Learning model;
- [ ] Improve the dataset analysis;
- [ ] Improve the Streamlit app.
